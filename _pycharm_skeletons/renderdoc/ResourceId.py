      These IDs do not overlap ever - textures, buffers, shaders and samplers will all have unique IDs

      re-used on replay - the corresponding resources created on replay to stand-in for capture-time
      resources are given unique IDs and a mapping is stored to between the capture-time resource and
      the replay-time one.
